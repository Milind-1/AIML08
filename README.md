# Task 8: K-Means Clustering

This repository contains my implementation of K-Means clustering for customer segmentation.

## Approach
1. Loaded and visualized the Mall Customer dataset
2. Applied the Elbow Method to determine optimal k=5
3. Validated with Silhouette Scores
4. Performed K-Means clustering and visualized results
5. Evaluated cluster quality with Silhouette Score (0.55)

## Files
- `kmeans_clustering.py`: Main implementation code
- `clusters.png`: Visualization of customer segments
- `elbow_method.png`: Plot for determining optimal k
